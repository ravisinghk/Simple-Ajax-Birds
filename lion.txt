The Himalayan Monal closely resembles a peacock, but has vast distinguishing features such as an iridescent rainbow-like plumage, a wiry metallic head and crest, and a reddish-brown neck.
Also known as the Himalayan Pheasant or the Impeyal Pheasant or danphe (not Daphne, that pretty chick from Scooby Doo), the Himalayan Monal is found in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas, especially in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttrakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.
An interesting fact is that in the first year of birth, the males and females resemble each other to quite a large extent.
