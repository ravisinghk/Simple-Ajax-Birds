Peacocks are actually considered sacred in Hinduism, because the spots in their tail signify the eyes of gods (which is quite hilarious if you think about it – god watching people through peacock’s tails, I bet that happens all the time).
With the thick blue-green plumage and the iconic rain dance performed while mating, peacocks generally thrive in rainforests and grasslands. However, to be pedantic, ‘peacock’ actually refers only to the males, and ‘peahen’ refers to the females. They are collectively known as peafowl. A collection of peafowl is also known as a ‘party’.
