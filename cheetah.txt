The fire-tailed myzornis is a member of the monotypic rare genus of – well, myzornis. It was formerly placed in the Old World Babbler Family (alongside George RR Martin and JRR Tolkien).
The fire tailed myzornis is the closest thing, both in names and looks, to an actual Pokemon; and is a local resident of the Himalayan range, living in subtropical or tropical montane forests. It is now a rare bird to be seen, slowly fading away in Nepal and China.
The name originates from the bright yellow, orange and red colours found at the edges of the bird’s tail, a stark contrast from its green body.
